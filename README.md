# A Periodic Batch Processing Framework in R

This is a package that aids in running analytical procedures in a periodic 
schedule. It may be useful in batch processing pipelines where new data are 
made available periodically.

The interface of most functions may change in future versions. Use with your own responsibility.


# Usage

Check the inline documentation. Some examples will be added here when the interfaces of the functions get more stable.
